### Some note
Sorry for my bad english and sketchy information. I'm newbie with hackintosh and I don't have best config in my EFI. This doc will be updated in the future. In my EFI and my use process, I use ethernet and I dont use wifi and bluetooth because I dont have kext for my device and As far as I know it's not supported. The second problem is about performance, it seems that I am not optimized well, and my job is to use xcode, the experience is not too good. The cause may come from optimizing hardware and software. I will upgrade ram and change hard drive in the near future to SSD. And I will also find some software and kext fixes. These will be mentioned in the next version.
